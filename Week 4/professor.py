#Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with
# digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
#Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number),
#the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem.
#If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
#The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
